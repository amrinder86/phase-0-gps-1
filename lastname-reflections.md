What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was having problems with Git fetch.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
John explained really well about Git Fetch.
What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I had no pair to work with. It was just my guide John and me. I asked John various questions about Git fetch, branches and about his overall Devbootcamp experience.
What still confuses you about Git?
I'm pretty comfortable working with Git and Github. Git merge and Git pull kind of confuses me but I'm getting the hang of it.
How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was awesome. I had a great time with John. He was very friendly and laid back and a great guide :) thank you John.
